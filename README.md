module-drag-and-scroll-by-brachamul
===================================

Enables both vertical and horizontal drag-and-scroll on a "map"-like object through a viewport spanning 100% of the browser's width and height.

This little module was created with the help of code from http://hitconsultants.com/dragscroll_scrollsync/scrollpane.html
